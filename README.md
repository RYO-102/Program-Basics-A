## About ce.c

### For Students of the Department of Information Systems
This program integrates the compilation and execution of C language programs into a single process.
I plan to continue improving it, so feel free to contact me with any suggestions or requests.

### Getting Started
1. Copy `ce.c` from this repository to your working directory (e.g., "Program Basics A" folder).
2. Open the terminal and enter the following command:
   ```cl ce.c```
3. Once `ce.exe` is generated, you are ready to proceed.

### Execution
To execute a C program, use the following command:
  ```ce <filename>```
- Replace `<filename>` with the name of your C file (e.g., use `test` for `test.c`).
- Only one file name should be specified at a time.
- The program first compiles and then executes the file. If a compilation error occurs, execution will be halted.
- If requested, I may update the program to allow execution of an existing `.exe` file even if compilation fails.
